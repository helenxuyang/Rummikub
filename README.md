# Rummikub
AP CS A picture project - starting from provided Java classes allowing for click interaction, recreated the board game Rummikub

This was my first major programming project, in which we were provided prewritten Java classes for manipulating images (displaying images, recording information about which pixel on the image was clicked) and were assigned to create a project that used the classes in any way. I decided to recreate my favorite board game, Rummikub, a number tile game for 2-4 players. More detail about the game is included in the how to play popup.
